# Brain Tumor MRI Classification (WIP)

This project is an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for classifying brain tumors from MRI scans using deep learning. It supports both model training and deployment, and currently includes evaluation tools and experimental tracking.

> ⚠️ **This is a work in progress.** API deployment, experiment tracking, and Dockerization are coming next.

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset used is from [Kaggle: Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset?resource=download)
